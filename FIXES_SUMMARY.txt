SUMMARY OF FIXES TO APPLY:

1. Make close button more visible (white on gray background, larger)
2. Keep header/navigation visible on desktop when chat opens
3. Invert social icons (dark on light background)

The main structural issue is that header/nav are inside the conditional hiding block. On desktop when chat opens, the entire main content area (including header) is being pushed down or hidden.

Let me create the complete fixed page.tsx with proper structure.
